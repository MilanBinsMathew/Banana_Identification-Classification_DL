# Banana_Identification-Classification_DL
A deep learning program that can be used to identify and classify bananas based on their ripeness.

The dataset contains over 350 images of bananas and the model tries to classify them into 4 categories, namely - Ripe, Midrripe, Overrip and Unripe. 

# Methodology 
The proposed approach here is to use Convolutional Neural Network architectures such as ResNet=50 and VGG-16 for extracting features form the images and then use Machine Learning Classifier (KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) for classification.

# Result
After fine-tuning of hyperparameters and evaluating the results it can be concluded that the VGG-16 model for feature extraction and Logistic Regression Classifier is the best method of the considered techniques.
